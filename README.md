# A Case Study on Linked Lists

    Hi! We are IT students from the PUP Quezon City Branch.

    We are tasked to create a program based on a specific problem
    that will utilize linked lists in its operations.

    This is a requirement for our course Data Structures and Algorithms.

# Instructions

    - Create a program using any available programming languages to address the problem.
    - The program should create two (2) lists of numbers using linked list.
    - Each list has a maximum capacity of (7) numbers only.
    - Each node can only carry a single digit.
    - Display the sum of the two lists. (see output below)
